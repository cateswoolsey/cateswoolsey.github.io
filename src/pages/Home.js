      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
        I recently graduated summa cum laude and was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society at Middlebury College, where I majored in Computer Science and minored in Art and Architectural Studies. My interests lie at the intersection of art, technology, and growth â€” exploring how creativity and innovation can drive meaningful experiences. With a background in both technical problem-solving and artistic analysis, I am passionate about designing and building solutions that blend functionality with aesthetics. I am eager to continue learning, collaborating, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of both fields.
