      <h2>ABOUT ME:</h2>
      <p>
        I am a graduating senior at Middlebury College, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in the History of Art and Architecture. My interests lie at the intersection of art, technology, and growth â€” exploring how creativity and innovation can drive meaningful experiences. With a background in both technical problem-solving and artistic analysis, I am passionate about designing and building solutions that blend functionality with aesthetics. I am eager to continue learning, collaborating, and contributing to projects that push the boundaries of both fields.
